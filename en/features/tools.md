This function only provides solutions, doesn't auto-assemble. You need to manually input the current quantity of each puzzle piece

The larger the specified maximum solution count, the longer it takes, but you might get a better solution. Recommended range 10~100. Setting too large solution count will cause lag

The generated solution is not globally optimal, but optimal among current solution count
